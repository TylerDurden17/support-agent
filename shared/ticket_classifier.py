# how to wrap a real use-case (classifying tickets) using LangChainâ€™s chain-of-components pattern
# It sets up your core reasoning pipeline â€” prompt â†’ model â†’ structured output.
# This example uses the Groq LLM to classify customer support tickets into categories, priorities, and sentiments.
# It demonstrates how to create a structured output using Pydantic models and LangChain's output parsers.
# Importing the ChatGroq class to interact with the Groq API using Langchain

from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
# ChatPromptTemplate is used to define and structure the prompt sent to the LLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
# JsonOutputParser ensures the LLM output is structured and can be parsed as JSON
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
# Pydantic's BaseModel and Field for structured data validation and type safety
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
# Standard Python typing module
from typing import List
# For handling environment variables

# Load environment variables from a .env file (used to keep API keys safe)

# Define a data model for the expected classification output using Pydantic
class TicketClassification(BaseModel): # ðŸ“Œ Pydantic model, used for data validation and parsing using Python type hints.
